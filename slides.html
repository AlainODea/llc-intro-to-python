        ## Today's project

        [[ small detail but should we take out the year so it can be reused next year? Or just update the CSV file and this slide?  - add graphics of cities ]]

        Imagine you're organizing **National Learn to Code Day 2015**. 

        You want it to be an *even bigger success* than last year, so not only do you need to know how many people attended (so you can beat that target), but you also want to pull other salient stats to put in a press release – news outlets *love* stats. 
        
        Computers are very good at repetitive tasks, but they require *precise instructions*. 

        Today, you'll learn to 'think' like a computer as you gather insights into who attended Ladies Learning Code workshops in 2014.
        
        Whether you take these tools and apply them to your own data or keep using the tools you know, by the end of the day, you'll hopefully have greater confidence in leveraging computers to do your work faster and focus on what matters to you.

      ## Getting Started

      You will need:

      [[ Added links to mac & windows version, though they should already come with python installed.  Should we say something about it being pre-installed on macs? Also, should we say to download the "latest" version and just note that syntax we're using is compatible in 2 & 3? ]]

      1. **Python 2.7.x installed** ( [Mac](https://www.python.org/downloads/), [Windows](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/) )
      1. **[Pycharm Educational Edition](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm-educational/)**

      1. **[Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en-CA/chrome/browser/)** - Choose a modern web browser that supports current web standards and has good development tools. To set Chrome as your default browser, follow [these instructions](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95417?hl=en). 

        (Visit [browsehappy.com](http://browsehappy.com) for more info about modern browsers.) 

      1. Learner files from LLC (containing the csv files), located in the **exercises** folder.

        ## What is programming?

        * Programming is giving instructions to your computer to get it to do things for you
        * Computers need *very specific* instructions
        * We use a programming language to give the computer instructions in a form that it can understand
        * Programming languages have syntax, just like human languages do

        1. Open the console

          ![Python Console in PyCharm](./framework/img/workshop/python-console.png)

         Note the `>>>` symbol. It is used by the console to represent a space for you to enter your input but you don&#39;t have to actually type it.

        ## Python can do math

        [[ added some extra info about >>>]]

        Open up the console in PyCharm (see previous slide) and try out these examples. The command you input into the console after the `>>>` gets *evaluated* and a value is returned back to you.

        ```
        >>> 2 + 2
        4
        ```

        ```
        >>> 2 * 15
        30
        ```

        ```
        >>> 1 / 2
        0
        ```
        Why is `1 / 2 = 0`? We&#39;ll come back to that.

        ## Types

        * Integer (`int`, whole numbers)
        * Float (numbers containing decimals)
        * String (`str`, words, sentences, literal text)
        * Boolean (true, false)
        * list
        * and more! [TODO: ADD LINK TO RESOURCE]
        * Use `type()` to figure out what type something is.

        ## Printing

        The `print()` **function** outputs values to the screen. Functions at its most basic definition holds a set of instructions. More on functions later. Also, note the usage of quotes. 

        ```
        >>> print("Hello World!")
        Hello World!
        ```

        ```
        >>> print(2 + 2)

        ## Concatenation


        ```
        >>> print("Hello " + "World!")
        Hello World!
        ```

        The above example doesn&#39;t output an error because both `"Hello "` and `"World!"` are both strings.  "Adding" strings together is called **concatenation** and it simply joins the strings.

        ```python
        >>> print(2 + "2")
        Traceback (most recent call last):
        File "<input>", line 1, in <module>
        TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'int' and 'str'
        ```
      </script>
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        ## Why did that error happen?

        Python needs to know what **type** something is to figure out how to work with it.  Let&#39;s look at the examples again.

        ```python
        >>> print(2 + "2")
        Traceback (most recent call last):
        File "<input>", line 1, in <module>
        TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'int' and 'str'
        ```


        * The first 2 is an integer.
        * `"2"` enclosed in the quotes, is a **string** type, or "literal text".
        * Python can&#39;t figure out how to add a number and string, so it spits out an error.


        ```
        >>> print("Hello " + "World!")
        Hello World!
        ```

      </script>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        ## Typecasting

        We can tell Python how to convert that `"2"` into a number and change the **type**. Try it in your console.

        ```
        >>> print(2 + int("2"))
        4
        ```

        And we can fix that problem from before where `1/2 = 0`
        ```
        >>> print(float(1) / float(2))
        0.5
        ```
        <br>
        The ability to tell Python to change the "type" will come in handy later.

<!--Variables-->
<!-- -------------------- -->

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        ## Variables
        * We usually want to store a value to use later
        * Variables store data in your computer&#39;s memory (like a book in a giant bookcase)
        * Use the equal (`=`) symbol to assign a value to a variable

        ```python
        >>> x = 5
        >>> y = 4
        >>> x * y
        20
        ```

        ```python
        >>> today = "Saturday"
        >>> print("Today is " + today)
        Today is Saturday

        ## Reassigning Variables

        [[ does this make sense? separated it from the previous example ]]

        Variables can be changed after you have assigned the value by "reassigning" them.

        ```python
        >>> x = 5
        >>> y = 4
        >>> x = 10
        >>> x * y
        ```

        What do you think the value of `x * y` will be?

        * Programmers use *comments* to leave notes for themselves (and other people reading their code in the future)
        * Good comments add information that isn't immediately obvious
        * You'll see more comments throughout the exercises

        ## Class Exercise 1: Hello World
        
        Now that you know how to use variables, we&#39;ll use a built-in function of Python `raw_input` to capture whatever you type and store it for you.  
        
        ```
        # raw_input takes whatever you pass it and puts it in a variable (remember, this is a comment)
        name = raw_input("Please enter your name so we can greet you: ")
        
        print("Hello " + name)

<!-- Conditionals & Booleans -->

        ## Conditionals &amp; Logic
        * The program we just wrote ran straight from top to bottom
        * What if the program could act differently and decide what to do?
        * Use conidtionals like and `if` statement
        * Each `if` statement contains a test, and the indented block is the code that will run if the test is `True` but not if it is `False` and looks something like this:
        
        ```python
        # Not real code
        if it is cold outside:
            wear a sweater
        else:
            dress normally :)
        ```
        
        You can also have more than one condition.

        ```python
        # Still not real code
        if it is cold outside:
            wear a sweater
        elif it is raining:
            bring an umbrella

        ## Boolean values

        [[ expanded definition of = and ==   double check? ]]
        
        How does `if` know what&#39;s `True` or `False`? We use 'Boolean' statements to test against values.

        Reminder, one equals symbol only *assigns* a value to the variable.

        ```python
        >>> weather = "raining"
        ```
        
        Test the values. The double equals symbol (`==`) will evaluate if the value on the right matches the assigned value.
        ```
        >>> weather == "cold"
        False
        >>> weather == "raining"
        True
        ```
        We can use these *statements* with our `if` values to test for our weather conditions

        Create a new file `ex2_weather_advice.py` and add the below code snippet.   
        Note the syntax and try to type in one line at a time.
        
        ```python

        if weather == "cold":
            print("Wear a sweater!")
        elif weather == "raining":
            print("Bring an umbrella")
        else:
            print("Dress normally :)")
        ```
        
        Try running your file a few times to get different advice (the weather is so unpredictable!)

        **Bonus: ** Update the conditions or add more conditions.

        ## Hint: Indentation

        [[ Not sure what the  ... in the code samples mean? ]]

        Python uses indentation to figure out which 'block' of code belongs inside the `if` or `else`.

        Whitespace is very important in Python!

        
        ```python
        >>> x = 6
        >>> if x > 5:
        ...     print("x is greater than 5!")
        ... else:
        ... print("x is something else!")
        File "<input>", line 5
            print("x is something else!")
                ^
        IndentationError: expected an indented block
        ```

        Sometimes, you can&#39;t neatly capture your conditions with one expression. You need to combine multiple expressions to determine what to do next.

        # Opening a file

        We typically store computer data in files. The data in some files is human-readable text (while in others, like images, it's in a format that's only readable by programs with specific code to interpret the data).

        It's fairly easy in Python to open a human-readable file and print the contents to the screen.

        ```python
        >>> chapters = open('./exercises/llc-chapters.csv')
        >>> print(chapters.read())
        # … lots of file data …
        >>> chapters.close()
        # When you're done with a file it's a good idea to close it
        ```
      </script>
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        # One line at a time

        In order to make use of the data in a file, we need to make sense of small portions at a time.

        In the `llc-chapters.csv` file, each line of the file represents a Ladies Learning Code Chapter

        Let's print out a few individual lines

        ```python
        >>> chapters = open('./exercises/llc-chapters.csv')
        >>> print(chapters.readline())
        City,Province,Chapter Lead(s)

        >>> print(chapters.readline())
        Vancouver,BC,Meghan

        >>> print(chapters.readline())
        Calgary,AB,Darcie

        >>> chapters.close()
        ```
      </script>
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>

        ## Comma-Separated Values (CSV) Files

        In the previous slide we printed out three lines in the file, one at a time.

        ```
        City,Province,Chapter Lead(s)
        Vancouver,BC,Meghan
        Calgary,AB,Darcie
        ```

        Notice that all three lines have exactly three values, separated by a comma (`,`)

        The first line doesn't tell us about a chapter, it has headings than describe the data in the next lines

        The second and third line each represent one of the LLC chapters.

        This is a specific *file format* called **CSV** (short for *comma-separated values*) that is used to represent spreadsheet-like data

        This is a widely used file-format because it's such a simple representation of rows and columns of data. It doesn't matter whether you're on a Mac, Windows, Linux or even on a web app like Google Docs – everyone can use this data.

        ## Reading all the lines in a file

        It's all well and good to print out the lines in a file one-at-a-time while you're learning, but surely, there's a better way to read *all* the lines in a file.

        In programming, when you want to perform the same action many times in a row, we use **loops**. In Python, the main kind of loop is the `for` loop.

        If we want to print each of the rows in our file, we can use the following code:

        ```python
        >>> chapters = open('./exercises/llc-chapters.csv')
        >>> for line in chapters:
        ...     print(line)
        ... 
        >>> chapters.close()
        ```

      </script>
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        ## `for` loop behind the scenes

        If you play around with the `chapters` variable in your console, you might notice that it has a `.next()` function which does the same thing as `.readline()`

        `for` can work with many different collections of data, all it's looking for is that `.next()` function.

        Behind the scenes, it's doing something roughly like

        ```python
        line = chapters.next()
        # Execute your code block
        # …
        # Go back to get the next value and repeat until there are no more values
        ```

        We'll use the for loop for our final exercise after lunch.

        ## Libraries

        Python has wonderful built in **libraries** which are collections of code that other people have written. Today we'll use the **csv** library. It contains instructions that tell python how to work with CSV files.

        This library will help us makes sense of the data contained in a CSV file to learn more about LLC activities in 2014.

        ## Reading data from a CSV file

        The CSV libary has a number of different tools for extracting actual data from a CSV file.

        Whereas before we were looking at the whole line, with the CSV library we can get individual pieces of data (like the cells of a spreadsheet)

        Today we'll mostly be using the `DictReader` tool because it makes it easier to understand the data in each row (without remembering anything about the headings)
        
        * First we open the file  
          
          ```
          >>> chapters_file = open('llc-chapters.csv')
          ```
        * Then, we import the `csv` library and pass it a reference to our file  
        
          ```
          >>> import csv
          >>> chapters_data = csv.DictReader(chapters_file)
          ```
        * Now, we can pull out one row at a time  
        
          ```
          >>> chapter = chapters_data.next()
          >>> print(chapter)
          {'City': 'Vancouver', 'Chapter Lead(s)': 'Meghan', 'Province': 'BC'}
          >>> type(chapter)
          <type 'dict'>

        ## Dictionaries

        This time, when we printed the values from the CSV file, instead of getting comma-separated values, we got a `dict`ionary representing each row in the file.

        Instead of having to remember which *column* represents city, we can access it with a keyword:

        ```python
        >>> chapter = {'City': 'Vancouver', 'Chapter Lead(s)': 'Meghan', 'Province': 'BC'}
        >>> print(chapter['City'])
        Vancouver
        >>> print(chapter['Province'])
        BC
        >>> print(chapter['Chapter Lead(s)'])
