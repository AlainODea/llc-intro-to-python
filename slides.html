        ## Today's project

        [[ small detail but should we take out the year so it can be reused next year? Or just update the CSV file and this slide? ]]

        Imagine you're organizing **National Learn to Code Day 2015**. 

        You want it to be an *even bigger success* than last year, so not only do you need to know how many people attended (so you can beat that target), but you also want to pull other salient stats to put in a press release – news outlets *love* stats. 
        
        Computers are very good at repetitive tasks, but they require *precise instructions*. 

        Today, you'll learn to 'think' like a computer as you gather insights into who attended Ladies Learning Code workshops in 2014.
        
        Whether you take these tools and apply them to your own data or keep using the tools you know, by the end of the day, you'll hopefully have greater confidence in leveraging computers to do your work faster and focus on what matters to you.

      ## Getting Started

      You will need:

      [[ Added links to mac & windows version, though they should already come with python installed.  Should we say something about it being pre-installed on macs? Also, should we say to download the "latest" version and just note that syntax we're using is compatible in 2 & 3? ]]

      1. **Python 2.7.x installed** ( [Mac](https://www.python.org/downloads/), [Windows](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/) )
      1. **[Pycharm Educational Edition](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm-educational/)**

      1. **[Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en-CA/chrome/browser/)** - Choose a modern web browser that supports current web standards and has good development tools. To set Chrome as your default browser, follow [these instructions](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95417?hl=en). 

        (Visit [browsehappy.com](http://browsehappy.com) for more info about modern browsers.) 

      1. Learner files from LLC (containing the csv files), located in the **exercises** folder.

        ## What is programming?

        * Programming is giving instructions to your computer to get it to do things for you
        * Computers need *very specific* instructions
        * We use a programming language to give the computer instructions in a form that it can understand
        * Programming languages have syntax, just like human languages do

        1. Open the console

          ![Python Console in PyCharm](./framework/img/workshop/python-console.png)

         Note the `>>>` symbol. It is used by the console to represent a space for you to enter your input but you don&#39;t have to actually type it.

        ## Python can do math

        [[ added some extra info about >>>]]

        Open up the console in PyCharm (see previous slide) and try out these examples. The command you input into the console after the `>>>` gets *evaluated* and a value is returned back to you.

        ```
        >>> 2 + 2
        4
        ```

        ```
        >>> 2 * 15
        30
        ```

        ```
        >>> 1 / 2
        0

        ## Printing

        [[ added some basic info about functions and syntax]]

        The `print()` **function** outputs values to the screen. Functions at its most basic definition holds a set of instructions. More on functions later. Also, note the usage of quotes. 

        ```
        >>> print("Hello World!")
        Hello World!
        ```

        ```
        >>> print(2 + 2)
        4
        ```

        ```
        >>> print("Hello " + "World!")
        Hello World!
        ```

        ```python
        >>> print(2 + "2")
        Traceback (most recent call last):
        File "<input>", line 1, in <module>
        TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'int' and 'str'
        ```
      </script>
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        ## Why did that error happen?

        [[ repeated examples from previous screen to compare and added the hello + world example to explain concatenation]]

        Python needs to know what **type** something is to figure out how to work with it.  Let&#39;s look at the examples again.

        ```python
        >>> print(2 + "2")
        Traceback (most recent call last):
        File "<input>", line 1, in <module>
        TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'int' and 'str'
        ```


        * The first 2 is an integer.
        * `"2"` enclosed in the quotes, is a **string** type, or "literal text".
        * Python can&#39;t figure out how to add a number and string, so it spits out an error.


        ```
        >>> print("Hello " + "World!")
        Hello World!
        ```

        The above example doesn&#39;t output an error because both `"Hello "` and `"World!"` are both strings.  "Adding" strings together is called **concatenation** and it simply joins the strings.

<!--Types-->
<!-- -------------------- -->

    
    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        ## Types

        [[ split up numbers into integers and floats. double check? Also, add link to resource ]]

        * Integer (`int`, whole numbers)
        * Float (numbers containing decimals)
        * String (`str`, words, sentences, literal text)
        * Boolean (true, false)
        * list
        * and more! [TODO: ADD LINK TO RESOURCE]
        * Use `type()` to figure out what type something is.

        ```
        >>> type("hello")
        <type 'str'>
        
        >>> type(42)
        <type 'int'>
        
        >>> type(3.14159)
        <type 'float'>
        
        >>> type([1, 2, 3, 4])
        <type 'list'>
        ```

    </section>
    
    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        ## Typecasting

        We can tell Python how to convert that `"2"` into a number and change the **type**. Try it in your console.

        ```
        >>> print(2 + int("2"))
        4
        ```

        And we can fix that problem from before where `1/2 = 0`
        ```
        >>> print(float(1) / float(2))
        0.5
        ```
        <br>
        The ability to tell Python to change the "type" will come in handy later.

        ## Variables
        * We usually want to store a value to use later
        * Variables store data in your computer&#39;s memory (like a book in a giant bookcase)
        * Use the equal (`=`) symbol to assign a value to a variable

        ```python
        >>> x = 5
        >>> y = 4
        >>> x * y

        ## Reassigning Variables

        [[ does this make sense? separated it from the previous example ]]

        Variables can be changed after you have assigned the value by "reassigning" them.

        ```python
        >>> x = 5
        >>> y = 4
        >>> x = 10
        >>> x * y
        ```

        What do you think the value of `x * y` will be?

        ## Class Exercise 1: Hello World
        
        Now that you know how to use variables, we&#39;ll use a built-in function of Python `raw_input` to capture whatever you type and store it for you.  
        
        ```
        # raw_input takes whatever you pass it and puts it in a variable (remember, this is a comment)

        ## Conditionals &amp; Logic
        * The program we just wrote ran straight from top to bottom
        * What if the program could act differently and decide what to do?
        * Use conidtionals like and `if` statement
        * Each `if` statement contains a test, and the indented block is the code that will run if the test is `True` but not if it is `False` and looks something like this:
        
        ```python
        # Not real code
        if it is cold outside:
            wear a sweater
        else:
            dress normally :)
        ```
        
        You can also have more than one condition.

        ```python
        # Still not real code
        if it is cold outside:
            wear a sweater
        elif it is raining:
            bring an umbrella

        ## Boolean values

        [[ expanded definition of = and ==   double check? ]]
        
        How does `if` know what&#39;s `True` or `False`? We use 'Boolean' statements to test against values.

        Reminder, one equals symbol only *assigns* a value to the variable.

        ```python
        >>> weather = "raining"
        ```
        
        Test the values. The double equals symbol (`==`) will evaluate if the value on the right matches the assigned value.
        ```
        >>> weather == "cold"
        False
        >>> weather == "raining"
        True
        ```
        We can use these *statements* with our `if` values to test for our weather conditions

        Create a new file `ex2_weather_advice.py` and add the below code snippet.   
        Note the syntax and try to type in one line at a time.

            print("Wear a sweater!")
        elif weather == "raining":
            print("Bring an umbrella")
        else:
            print("Dress normally :)")
        ```
        
        Try running your file a few times to get different advice (the weather is so unpredictable!)

        ## Hint: Indentation

        [[ Not sure what the  ... in the code samples mean? ]]

        Python uses indentation to figure out which 'block' of code belongs inside the `if` or `else`.

        Whitespace is very important in Python!

        
        ```python
        >>> x = 6
        >>> if x > 5:
        ...     print("x is greater than 5!")
        ... else:
        ... print("x is something else!")
        File "<input>", line 5
            print("x is something else!")
                ^
        IndentationError: expected an indented block
        ```

        ## Testing numbers with Math Comparison Operators  
        
        Just as you could check the exact value of a string or number you can use typical math operators to check relative numeric values
        
        `>`: Greater than  
        `<`: Less than  
        `>=`: Greater than or equal to  
        `<=`: Less than or equal to  

        ```python
        >>> x = 5
        >>> print(x > 5)
        False
        >>> print(x >= 5)
        True
        
        >>> if x >= 5:
        ...     print(x + " is greater than or equal to 5")
        ... else:
        ...     print(x + " is less than 5")
        ...

        ## And / Or

        Sometimes, you can&#39;t neatly capture your conditions with one expression. You need to combine multiple expressions to determine what to do next.

        `and`: both things must be true  
        `or`: Either one, or both things must be true.
        
        ```python
        weather = "cold"
        snowing = True
        
        >>> if weather == "cold" and snowing == True:
        ...     print("wear a winter jacket")

        ## Loops

        [[ add link to documentaion ]]

        Sometimes we want the program to do something many times. Computers and programming are excellent at repetitive tasks.

        ### While Loop
        
        A **while** loop runs forever until you tell it to stop.
        
        ```
        while True:
          print("Are we there yet?")
        ```
        
        ### For Loop
        A **for** loop needs to know exactly how many times to run

        ```
        for i in range(1,10):
          print(i)
        ```

        Today we will be using **for loops** and will go into more detail in the afternoon.

        ## Lists

        * Programming languages have data structures, a particular way of organizing data
        * You can store multiple things in one variable name by using a list
        * Each list element has an index, **starting at 0**

        ```
        my_list = [1234, "hello", True]
        ```

        `my_list` is the variable  name  
        `[1234, "hello", True]` is the whole list element  
        `1234` has an index of 0  
        `"hello"` has an index of 1   
        `True` has an index of 2

        [[ is this a type along exercise? ]]

        Grab one list element by using square brackets and the index number.

        <br>
        You can also add values to a list using `append()` and using a period (`.`) to attach it to the variable.

        ## Comma Separated Value (CSV) Files

        [[ added short sentence for why you would use CSV - double check? ]]

        We can use CSV files to hold data to use in our program. A CSV file looks something like this:

        Example: Breakfast foods

        ```
        Weekday, Food, Drink, Location
        Monday, Eggs, Juice, Home
        Tuesday, Oatmeal, Coffee, Work
        Wednesday, Pancakes, Tea, Home
        Thursday, Nutella Crepes, Cappucino, Cafe
        ... and so on.
        ```

        Each item, on each row, has something to do with a particular *instance* of breakfast.  
        The day, food, drinks, and where you ate it.

        ## Libraries

        Python has wonderful built in **libraries** which are collections of code that other people have written. Today we will use a library called **csv**. It contains instructions that tell python how to work with csv files.

        Our goal with the final project will be to get Python to open up a file for us and look through it for information.
        
        In PyCharm, open up the file **llc-chapters.csv**. It has the same kind of format as the last example.

        ## Opening a File

        [[ create file in exercises folder?]]
        
        Create a new Python file in PyCharm called **chapterleads.py** in the **exercises** folder.

        (Right click or two-finger tap<!-- .element: class="footnote" --> **exercises** and select **New > New Python File**)

        To access the code in the csv library, type the below snippet.
        
        ```
        import csv
        ```
        
        To open the file, and print out the contents, type: 
        
        ```
        csv_file = open('llc-chapters.csv')
        csv_data = csv.reader(csv_file)

        for row in csv_data:
          print(row)
        ```

        Then run the file and check the results in the console.
