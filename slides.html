        ## Today's project

        Imagine you're organising **National Learn to Code Day 2015**. You want it to be an *even bigger success* than last year, so not only do you need to know how many people attended (so you can beat that target), but you also want to pull other salient stats to put in a press release – news outlets *love* stats. 
        
        Computers are very good at repetitive tasks, but they require *precise instructions*. Today, you'll learn to 'think' like a computer as you gather insights into who attended Ladies Learning Code workshops in 2014.
        
        <small>Whether you take these tools and apply them to your own data or keep using the tools you know, by the end of the day, you'll hopefully have greater confidence in leveraging computers to do your work faster and focus on what matters to you.</small>

        ## What is programming?

        * Programming is giving instructions to your computer to get it to do things for you
        * Except computers are stupid and need very specific instructions
        * We use a programming language to give the computer instructions in a form that it can understand
        * Programming languages have syntax, just like human languages do

        ## Python can do math

        Open up the console in PyCharm (see previous slide)

        ```
        >>> 2 + 2
        4
        ```

        ```
        >>> 2 * 15

        ```

        ```
        >>> 1 / 2
        0
        ```
        Why is `1 / 2 = 0`? We'll come back to that.

        ## Printing

        The `print()` function outputs values to the screen

        ```
        >>> print("Hello World!")
        Hello World!
        ```

         ```
        >>> print("Hello " + "World!")
        Hello World!
        ```

        ```
        >>> print(2 + 2)
        4
        ```

        ```python
        >>> print(2 + "2")
        Traceback (most recent call last):
        File "<input>", line 1, in <module>
        TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'int' and 'str'
        ```
      </script>
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        ## Why did that error happen?

        * Python needs to know what "type" something is so it can figure out how to work with it.
        * The first 2 is an integer.
        * "2" is a string, or "literal text".
        * Python can&#39;t figure out how to add a number and string, so it spit out an error.

      </script>
    </section>

<!--Types-->
<!-- -------------------- -->

    
    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        ## Types
        * Numbers (such as integer &amp; float)
        * Strings
        * Boolean (true, false)
        * lists
        * and more!
        * Use `type()` to figure out what type something is.

        ```
        >>> type("hello")
        <type 'str'>
        
        >>> type(42)
        <type 'int'>
        
        >>> type(3.14159)
        <type 'float'>
        
        >>> type([1, 2, 3, 4])
        <type 'list'>
        ```
      </script>
    </section>
    
    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        ## Typecasting

         We can tell python how to convert that "2" into a number.

        ```
        >>> print(2 + int("2"))
        4
        ```
         And we can fix that problem from before where 1/2 = 0
        ```
        >>> print(float(1) / float(2))
        0.5
        ```

        The ability to tell python to change the "type" will come in handy later.

<!--Variables-->
<!-- -------------------- -->

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        ## Variables
        * We usually want to store a value to use later
        * Variables store data in your computer's memory (like a book in a giant bookcase)
        * Use the '=' symbol to assign a value to a variable

        ```python
        >>> x = 5
        >>> y = 4
        >>> x * y
        20
        ```

        ```python
        >>> today = "Saturday"
        >>> print("Today is " + today)
        Today is Saturday
        ```
        
        * Variables can change over time

        ```python
        >>> x = 10
        >>> x * y
        40
        ```

        ## Exercise 1: Hello World
        
        Now that you know how to use variables, we'll use a built-in function of Python `raw_input` to capture whatever you type and store it for you.  
        
        ```
        # raw_input takes whatever you pass it and puts it in a variable
        name = raw_input("Please enter your name so we can greet you: ")
        
        print("Hello " + name)

          Run > Run…  
          ![Run your program](./framework/img/workshop/run-file.png)
        * Click on `ex1_hello_world` (again) in the menu that appears in the middle of the screen  
          ![Click to run your program](./framework/img/workshop/run-mini-menu.png)
        * Now click into the console window that opened, type your name and press the Enter key  
          ![Demo of hello_world example](./framework/img/workshop/ex1-hello-world.png)

        ## Hint: Comments
        * Programmers use *comments* to leave notes for themselves (and other people reading their code in the future)
        * Good comments add information that isn't immediately obvious
        * You'll see more comments throughout the exercises

        * The program we just wrote ran straight from top to bottom
        * What if the program could act differently and decide what to do?
        * Each `if` statement contains a test, and the intented block below is the code that will run if the test is `True` but not if it is `False`
        
        ```python
        # Not real code
        if it is cold outside:
            wear a sweater
        else:
            dress normally :)
        ```
        
        * Sometimes we have more conditions

        ```python
        # Still not real code
        if it is cold outside:
            wear a sweater
        elif it is raining:

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        ## Boolean values
        
        * How does `if` know what's `True` or `False`? We use 'Boolean' statements to test against values

        ```python
        >>> weather = "raining"
        >>> weather == "cold"
        False
        >>> weather == "raining"

        # file: ex2_weather_advice.py

            * Whitespace is important in Python!
        
        ```python
        >>> x = 6

        ...     print("x is greater than 5!")

        ## Testing numbers
        
        Just as you could check the exact value of a string or number you can use typical math operators to check relative numeric values
        
        ### Math Comparison Operators  
        `>`: Greater than  
        `<`: Less than  
        `>=`: Greater than or equal to  
        `<=`: Less than or equal to  

        ```python
        >>> x = 5
        >>> print(x > 5)
        False
        >>> print(x >= 5)
        True
        
        >>> if x >= 5:
        ...     print(x + " is greater than or equal to 5")
        ... else:
        ...     print(x + " is less than 5")

      <script type="text/template">
        ## And / Or

        Sometimes, you can't neatly capture your conditions with one expression. You need to combine multiple expressions to determine what to do next 
        
        ```python
        weather = "cold"
        snowing = True
        
        >>> if weather == "cold" and snowing == True:
        ...     print("wear a winter jacket")
        ... 
        
        wear a winter jacket
        >>> if weather == "raining" or snowing == True:
        ...     print("bring a change of socks")
        ... 
        bring a change of socks
        ```
        
        `and`: both things must be true  
        `or`: Either one, or both things must be true.

          * Programming languages have data structures
          * You can store multiple things in one variable name
          * Each list element has an index, starting at 0

          ```

        ## Comma Separated Value (CSV) Files
        A CSV file looks something like this:
         ```
        Example: Breakfast foods

        Weekday, Food, Drink, Location
        Monday, Eggs, Juice, Home
        Tuesday, Oatmeal, Coffee, Work
        Wednesday, Pancakes, Tea, Home
        Thursday, Nutella Crepes, Cappucino, Cafe
        ... and so on.
        ```
        Each item on each row has something to do with a particular <i>instance</i> of breakfast. The day, food, drinks, and where you ate it.  </br>

        ## Libraries

        Our goal with the final project will be to get python to open up a file for us and look through it for information.
        
        In pycharm, open up the file <i>llc-chapters.csv</i>. It has the same kind of format as the last example. 

        Python has wonderful built in <i>libraries</i> which are collections of code that other people have written. 

        Today we will use a library called <i>csv</i>. It contains instructions that tell python how to work with csv files. 

        More info: https://docs.python.org/2/library/csv.html

        ## Opening a File

        Create a new python file in pycharm called 'chapterleads.py'.  

        To access the code in the csv library, type: 
         ```
        import csv
        ```
        To open the file, and print out the contents, type: 
        ```
        csv_file = open('llc-chapters.csv')
        csv_data = csv.reader(csv_file)

        for row in csv_data:
            print(row)
        ```
        Then run the file.

        ## What does it all mean?

        Christina please create a table so we can compare the code line by line.
        data for the right hand side is in comments.
         ```
        import csv     #fetch the library
       
        csv_file = open('llc-chapters.csv') # open the file and store it in this variable. 
        csv_data = csv.reader(csv_file) # From the csv library, get a function called reader. It goes through each line of the file and stores whatever it finds in a list of strings. 

        for row in csv_data:   #for each row of data that the reader got for us, print it out.
            print(row)

        ## Functions
        * Hold a set of instructions and can take *arguments* (variables) to give you different results
        * Give a name to functionality like variables give a name to data
